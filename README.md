</div>

## 👋🏻 Welcome

After a fresh start on a fresh Classic Hardcore server I decided to get into addon development again. This is the first addon I've created in a long time and maybe the last one, too. Have fun :)

## ✨ Features

The addon offers a lot of the features you know from other addons of this type:

-   Displays current XP in relation to current maximum XP and XP left to reach next level
-   Calculates XP per hour rates and time left to reach next level
-   Experience rate is saved and used for calculation in subsequent sessions
-   Level progress is displayed color coded on a scale from red to green

## 📦 Download & Installation

~~This addon is available on [CurseForge][curseforge-release-link]. You can use the CurseForge app to download and stay up to date with this addon.~~

If you don't want to use CurseForge you can just [download the current version][github-release-link] from Github and drop the contents of the folder into your WoW addons folder.

## 🔨 Usage

Use [Shift] + Left click to move the frame to the desired position. Use- `/xpleft` slash command to toggle visibility.

## 🏭 Todo

-   Hide on max level
-   Add slash command to reset saved experience rate
-   Add slash command to reset frame position
-   Tooltip to show movement options
-   Improve number format
