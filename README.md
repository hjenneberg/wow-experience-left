</div>

## üëãüèª Welcome

After a fresh start on a fresh Classic Hardcore server I decided to get into addon development again. This is the first addon I've created in a long time and maybe the last one, too. Have fun :)

## ‚ú® Features

The addon offers a lot of the features you know from other addons of this type:

-   Displays current XP in relation to current maximum XP and XP left to reach next level
-   Calculates XP per hour rates and time left to reach next level
-   Experience rate is saved and used for calculation in subsequent sessions
-   Level progress is displayed color coded on a scale from red to green

## üì¶ Download & Installation

~~This addon is available on [CurseForge][curseforge-release-link]. You can use the CurseForge app to download and stay up to date with this addon.~~

If you don't want to use CurseForge you can just [download the current version][github-release-link] from Github and drop the contents of the folder into your WoW addons folder.

## üî® Usage

### Slash commands

- Use `/xpleft show` to show the xp frame
- Use `/xpleft hide` to hide the xp frame
- Use `/xpleft center` to move the xp frame back to its initial position
- Use `/xpleft reset` to reset saved xp rates from previous sessions

### How to move the frame

- Use [Shift] + Left click to move the frame to the desired position

## üè≠ Todo

-   Tooltip to show movement options
-   Show help for slash commands
-   Improve number format
