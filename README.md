</div>

## 👋🏻 Welcome

After a fresh start on a fresh Classic Hardcore server I decided to get into addon development again. This is the first addon I've created in a long time and maybe the last one, too. Have fun :)

## ✨ Features

The addon offers a lot of the features you know from other addons of this type:

- Displays current XP in relation to current maximum XP and XP left to reach next level
- Calculates XP per hour rates and time left to reach next level
- Experience rate is saved and used for calculation in subsequent sessions
- Level progress is displayed color coded on a scale from red to green

## 📦 Installation

The addon isn't available on CurseForge right now.

Just download the repository and drop the folder into your WoW addons folder. Start the game and enjoy.

## 🔨 Usage

Use [Shift] + Left click to move the frame to the desired position. Use- `/xpleft` slash command to toggle visibility.

## 🏭 Todo

- Add slash command to reset saved experience rate
- Add slash command to reset frame position
- Improve number format
- Get published on CurseForge
